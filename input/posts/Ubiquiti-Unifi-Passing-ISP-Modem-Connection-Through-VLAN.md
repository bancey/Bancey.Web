# Ubiquiti Unifi: Configuring VLANs


Let me first caveat this post by saying that I am in no way an expert in this field, the information provided here has been procured through trial and error and has worked in my environment.

A couple of years ago I invested in some Ubiquiti Unifi equipment to replace my ISP's "all-in-one" box due to poor performance, since the inital setup and install I haven't had any issues which is great. The downside of this approach is that the majority of my network equipment now doesn't fit in cabinet where the fibre line comes into the house. The following devices are crammed into the small cabinet:
- Optical Network Terminal (ONT)
- POE Switch
- Unifi Security Gateway
